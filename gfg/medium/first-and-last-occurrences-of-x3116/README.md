# First and Last in Sorted

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given a sorted array  **arr[]**  with possibly some duplicates, find the first and last occurrences of an element  **x**  in the given array.
 **Note:**  If the number  **x**  is not found in the array then return both the indices as -1.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 67, 123, 125], x = 5
Output: [2, 5]
Explanation: First occurrence of 5 is at index 2 and last occurrence of 5 is at index 5

```

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 123, 125], x = 7
Output: [6, 6]
Explanation: First and last occurrence of 7 is at index 6

```

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3], x = 4
Output: [-1, -1]
Explanation: No occurrence of 4 in the array, so, output is [-1, -1]
```

```java

    ArrayList<Integer> find(int arr[], int x) {
        ArrayList<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        result.add(findFirst(arr, x));
        result.add(findLast(arr, x));
        return result;
    }

    private int findFirst(int[] arr, int x) {
        int low = 0, high = arr.length - 1;
        int first = -1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] == x) {
                first = mid;
                high = mid - 1;
            } else if (arr[mid] < x) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return first;
    }

    private int findLast(int[] arr, int x) {
        int low = 0, high = arr.length - 1;
        int last = -1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] == x) {
                last = mid;
                low = mid + 1;
            } else if (arr[mid] < x) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return last;
    }
