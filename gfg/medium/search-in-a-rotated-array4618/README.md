# Search in Rotated Sorted Array

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an array  **arr[]**  of  **distinct** elements, which was initially  **sorted in ascending order**  but then  **rotated**  at some unknown pivot, the task is to find the index of a target  **key**.  If the key is not present in the array, return  **-1**.

 **Examples :** 

```
Input: arr[] = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3], key = 3
Output: 8
Explanation: 3 is found at index 8.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [3, 5, 1, 2], key = 6
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no element that has value 6.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [33, 42, 72, 99], key = 42
Output: 1
Explanation: 42 is found at index 1.
```

```java
class Solution {
    int search(int[] arr, int key) {
        int low = 0, high = arr.length - 1;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            if (arr[mid] == key) {
                return mid;
            }

            if (arr[low] <= arr[mid]) {
                if (key >= arr[low] && key < arr[mid]) {
                    high = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    low = mid + 1;
                }
            } else {
                if (key > arr[mid] && key <= arr[high]) {
                    low = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    high = mid - 1;
                }
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }
}
