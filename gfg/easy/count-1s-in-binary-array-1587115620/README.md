# Count 1's in binary array

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given a binary array that is  **sorted**  in  **non-increasing**  order, meaning all the  **1's**  appear before the  **0's**. Find the total number of `1'`s present in the array.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
Output: 5
Explaination: Count of 1's in the array is 5.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
Output: 7
Explaination: Count of 1's in the array is 7.

```

**Constraints:
**1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105 
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1

```java
class Solution {
    public int countOnes(int[] arr) {
        int low = 0, high = arr.length - 1;
        int ans = 0;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            if (arr[mid] == 1) {
                ans = mid + 1;
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```
