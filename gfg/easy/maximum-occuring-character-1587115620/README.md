# Most Frequent Character

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a string  **s** of lowercase alphabets. The task is to find the maximum occurring character in the string  **s**. If more than one character occurs the maximum number of times then print the lexicographically smaller character.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: s = "testsample"
Output: 'e'
Explanation: 'e' is the character which is having the highest frequency.
```

```
Input: s = "output"
Output: 't'
Explanation: 't' and 'u' are the characters with the same frequency, but 't' is lexicographically smaller.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100

```java
class Solution {
    public static char getMaxOccuringChar(String line) {
        int[] freq = new int[26];

        for (int i = 0; i < line.length(); i++) {
            freq[line.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }

        int maxFreq = 0;
        char result = 'a';

        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (freq[i] > maxFreq) {
                maxFreq = freq[i];
                result = (char) (i + 'a');
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
