## Problem

Given a string  **s** containing alphanumeric characters. You have to calculate the sum of all the numbers present in the string.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: s = "1abc23"
Output: 24
Explanation: 1 and 23 are numbers in the string which is added to get the sum as 24.

```

```
Input: s = "geeks4geeks"
Output: 4
Explanation: 4 is the only number, so the sum is 4.
```

 **Constraints:**

```java
class Solution {
    public static int findSum(String s) {
        int sum = 0;
        int currentNumber = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char ch = s.charAt(i);

            if (Character.isDigit(ch)) {
                currentNumber = currentNumber * 10 + (ch - '0');
            } else {
                sum += currentNumber;
                currentNumber = 0;
            }
        }
        sum += currentNumber;

        return sum;
    }
}
```
