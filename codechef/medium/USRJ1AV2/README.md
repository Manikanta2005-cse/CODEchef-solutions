## Problem

### Scanner Methods

Listen

You have already seen how to read a `String`. Let's see how to read the other `datatype` values:

- nextInt(): Reads integer values.
- nextFloat(): Reads float value.
- nextDouble(): Reads double value.
- nextBoolean(): Reads boolean value.
- nextLine(): Reads string value until newline character ('\n') is encountered.
- next(): Reads string value until space or newline character is encountered.
### Task

 **Write a program for the following** :

- Declare an integer variable num.
- Read the value from the user.
- Print it's square.
