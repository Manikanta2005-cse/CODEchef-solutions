## Problem

### Coronavirus Spread

There are $N$ people on a street (numbered $1$ through $N$). For simplicity, we'll view them as points on a line. For each valid $i$, the position of the $i$-th person is $X_i$.

It turns out that exactly one of these people is infected with the virus COVID-19, but we do not know which one. The virus will spread from an infected person to a non-infected person whenever the distance between them is at most $2$. If we wait long enough, a specific set of people (depending on the person that was infected initially) will become infected; let's call the size of this set the  *final number of infected people*.

Your task is to find the smallest and largest value of the final number of infected people, i.e. this number in the best and in the worst possible scenario.

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-seperated integers $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_N$.
### Output

For each test case, print a single line containing two space-separated integers ― the minimum and maximum possible final number of infected people.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 2,000$
- $2 \le N \le 8$
- $0 \le X_i \le 10$ for each valid $i$
- $X_1 \lt X_2 \lt \ldots \lt X_N$
### Subtasks

 **Subtask #1 (10 points):**  $N \le 3$

 **Subtask #2 (90 points):**  original constraints

```

```
1 1
3 3
2 3
```

### Explanation:

 **Example case 1:**  The distance between the two people is $3$, so the virus cannot spread and at the end, there will always be only one infected person.

 **Example case 2:**  The distance between each two adjacent people is $2$, so all of them will eventually get infected.

 **Example case 3:** 

- In one of the best possible scenarios, the person at the position $1$ is infected initially and the virus will also infect the person at the position $2$.
- In one of the worst possible scenarios, the person at the position $5$ is infected initially and the virus will also infect the people at the positions $6$ and $7$.

        int t = sc.nextInt();
        while (t-- > 0) {

            int[] x = new int[n];
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                x[i] = sc.nextInt();
            }
            int minInfected = n;
            int maxInfected = 1;
            int currentCluster = 1;

            for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
                if (x[i] - x[i - 1] <= 2) {
                    currentCluster++;
                } else {
                    minInfected = Math.min(minInfected, currentCluster);
                    maxInfected = Math.max(maxInfected, currentCluster);
                    currentCluster = 1;
                }
            }
            minInfected = Math.min(minInfected, currentCluster);
            maxInfected = Math.max(maxInfected, currentCluster);

            System.out.println(minInfected + " " + maxInfected);
        }
        sc.close();
    }
}
