## Problem

### Chef and Dolls

 

Chef is fan of pairs and he likes all things that come in pairs. He even has a doll collection in which the dolls come in pairs. One day while going through his collection he found that there are odd number of dolls. Someone had stolen a doll!!!

Help chef find which type of doll is missing..

### Input

The first line contains an integer  **T**, the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer  **N**, the number of dolls.
The next  **N**  lines are the types of dolls that are left.

### Output

For each test case, display the type of doll that doesn't have a pair, in a new line.

### Constraints

1<=T<=10
1<=N<=100000 (10^5)
0<=type<=100000

### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
1
3
1 
2
1
```

```
2
```

### Explanation:

For this case, we have three dolls [1, 2, 1]. So we have two dolls of type 1, but only one doll of type 2. Thus one doll of type 2 is missing.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
1
5
1
1
2
2
3
```

```
3
```

### Explanation:

For this case [1, 1, 2, 2, 3], we have two dolls of type 1 and 2, but only one doll of type 3. Thus one doll of type 3 is missing.

class Codechef {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        if (!sc.hasNextInt()) return;
        int t = sc.nextInt();
        
        while (t-- > 0) {
            int n = sc.nextInt();
            HashMap<Integer, Integer> counts = new HashMap<>();
            
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                int type = sc.nextInt();
                counts.put(type, counts.getOrDefault(type, 0) + 1);
            }
            
            for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : counts.entrySet()) {
                if (entry.getValue() % 2 != 0) {
                    System.out.println(entry.getKey());
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        sc.close();
    }
}
```
